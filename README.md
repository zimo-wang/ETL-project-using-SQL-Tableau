# ETL-project-using-SQL-Tableau

This is my first try of an ETL project using SQL and Tableau with PDF report.

### Objective:

The objective is to analyze and visualize the US rental market data from Craigslist of a given month.

### Data Source:

https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/austinreese/usa-housing-listings

### Methodology:

The data contains rental market details such as price per month, square feet, pets permission, etc. Once as an international college student, I stuggled searching and comparing prices and other details of different houses. Assuming I am looking for a rental and would like to draw some insights from the data. I use SQL and Tableau to clean data and visualize for insights with the following steps:
- Import data to MySQL server
- Run SQL queries to clean, filter and rearrange data
- Export data to local file and connect to Tableau
- Visualize data using Tableau
- Prepare analysis report for presentation
